[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Deletes  an  empty  S3  bucket.  A  bucket  must be completely empty of
       objects and versioned objects before it can be  deleted.  However,  the
       [1m--force  [22mparameter  can  be used to delete the non-versioned objects in
       the bucket before the bucket is deleted.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1mpath [22m(string)

       [1m--force [22m(boolean) Deletes all  objects  in  the  bucket  including  the
       bucket  itself. Note that versioned objects will not be deleted in this
       process which would cause the  bucket  deletion  to  fail  because  the
       bucket  would  not  be empty. To delete versioned objects use the [1ms3api[0m
       [1mdelete-object [22mcommand with the [1m--version-id [22mparameter.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following [1mrb [22mcommand removes a bucket.  In this example, the user's
       bucket  is  [1mmybucket[22m.   Note  that the bucket must be empty in order to
       remove:

          aws s3 rb s3://mybucket

       Output:

          remove_bucket: mybucket

       The following [1mrb [22mcommand uses the [1m--force [22mparameter to first remove all
       of  the  objects  in  the bucket and then remove the bucket itself.  In
       this example, the user's bucket is [1mmybucket [22mand the objects in [1mmybucket[0m
       are [1mtest1.txt [22mand [1mtest2.txt[22m:

          aws s3 rb s3://mybucket --force

       Output:

          delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt
          delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt
          remove_bucket: mybucket
